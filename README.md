# Hotaru

Hotaru is currently under heavy development and will eventually be a backend for mobile apps that includes built-in user management and synchronization. It aims to be lightweight, predictable, robust and magic-free.

Hotaru is built around cloud functions which are called on the client, execute on the server and return on the client, similar to Parse's cloud code.
